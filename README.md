# Ancient Greek Lookup (beta)

Greetings! This is an Ancient Greek definition lookup tool. It was built because most translation tools are designed for Greek-to-English translation rather than English-to-Greek; also, they are rather cumbersome to use as they involve a lot of cracking open of large books.

## Using this tool

To get started, enter a word and its meaning into the dictionary. Then search for it the meaning and see it come up.

The idea is that this will help to crowd-source the Greek project. However, we may port it automatically in the future.

## Developers

To get started with development, clone this repository then run the following commands:

`npm install`
`npm start`
