# Ancient Greek Lookup (beta)

Greetings! This is an Ancient Greek definition lookup tool. It was built because most translation tools are designed for Greek-to-English translation rather than English-to-Greek; also, they are rather cumbersome to use as they involve a lot of cracking open of large books.

## Using this tool

Coming soon.

## Developers

To get started with developmet, clone this repository then run the following commands:
